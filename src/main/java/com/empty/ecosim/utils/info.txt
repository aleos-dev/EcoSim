1. **RandomUtil**:
   - Generates random numbers, directions, or selections.
   - For instance, deciding if a predator successfully hunts prey, choosing a random direction for an animal to move, or determining if a plant grows in a specific cell.

2. **ConfigLoader**:
   - Loads configuration or parameters for the simulation, possibly from a properties file or JSON file.
   - Helps in changing simulation parameters without modifying the code, e.g., initial counts of animals, island dimensions, etc.

3. **SimulationLogger**:
   - Custom logger for the simulation.
   - Allows you to log specific events or statistics in a desired format.

4. **FileUtil**:
   - Helps with any file-related operations, like reading initial setup from a file, writing statistics to a file, etc.

5. **ValidationUtil**:
   - Provides methods to validate certain conditions, like checking if a cell is within island boundaries.

6. **ConversionUtil** (if needed):
   - Helps in converting between different data types, formats, or units.

7. **Constants**:
   - A class or interface that contains constant values used throughout the simulation, e.g., maximum number of animals per cell, weight thresholds for animals, etc.

Example of a **RandomUtil** class:

```java
package utils;

import java.util.Random;

public class RandomUtil {
    private static final Random random = new Random();

    public static int getRandomInt(int lowerBound, int upperBound) {
        return random.nextInt(upperBound - lowerBound) + lowerBound;
    }

    public static double getRandomDouble() {
        return random.nextDouble();
    }

    public static boolean getRandomBoolean() {
        return random.nextBoolean();
    }

    // ... other methods ...
}
```

The classes in the `utils` package should be designed to be reusable and generic so that they can be easily used across different parts of the application.
