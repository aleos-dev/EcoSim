1. **ThreadPoolManager**:
   - Manages the creation, execution, and shutdown of thread pools.
   - Can have methods to submit tasks and manage different thread pools (e.g., a scheduled thread pool for periodic tasks and a regular thread pool for animal actions).

2. **AnimalTask**:
   - Represents a task that a specific animal would perform in a given simulation cycle. This could include actions like moving, eating, reproducing, etc.

3. **PlantGrowthTask**:
   - Represents a task that simulates the growth or spread of plants in the simulation.

4. **IslandStatsTask**:
   - A task that calculates and prints out statistics about the current state of the island.

5. **IslandSimulationTask** (optional):
   - A task that runs an entire simulation cycle. This could be helpful if you want to run multiple simulations in parallel with different starting parameters.

6. **ThreadExceptionHandler**:
   - A class that implements `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler`. Helps in handling any exceptions that might occur in the threads.

7. **TaskResult** (optional):
   - If you need to get results back from the tasks, this class can be a container for any results or statistics generated from a task.

8. **CustomThreadFactory** (optional):
   - If you want more control over the creation of threads, such as naming threads or setting their priorities, you can create a custom thread factory.

Example:

```java
package threading;

import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolManager {
    private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduledThreadPool;
    private final ExecutorService regularThreadPool;

    public ThreadPoolManager() {
        this.scheduledThreadPool = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(5);
        this.regularThreadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
    }

    public Future<?> submitTask(Runnable task) {
        return regularThreadPool.submit(task);
    }

    public ScheduledFuture<?> scheduleTask(Runnable task, long delay, TimeUnit unit) {
        return scheduledThreadPool.schedule(task, delay, unit);
    }

    // ... other methods ...
}
```

This structure should give you a solid foundation for multi-threading in your simulation. Depending on the complexity and requirements of your simulation, you might need to add, remove, or modify some of these classes.
